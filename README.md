## SharPei or Crescent Roll is a memory clicky game 

The game is deployed on Heroku here --> https://sharpeiorcrescent.herokuapp.com/  

### Playing and Scoring

There are 12 images in the game. Some are dogs of breed Sharpei, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei, others <br>
are crescent rolls (aka croissants). Can you tell the difference? 
<p> Click each image, one at a time. Avoid clicking the same image more than once. Each time you click an image, <br>
the images will shuffle. If you haven't clicked the image before, in the same round, you will score a point. <br> 
Score 12 points and you win! <p>
Whether you win or lose, just enjoy and try to improve your memory. Click again to restart the game.
